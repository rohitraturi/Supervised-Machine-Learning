Data Dimension: 569 Instances X 32 Attributes

### Attribute Information:

1) ID number 

2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign) 

3-32) Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus: 
- radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter) 
- texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values) 
- perimeter 
- area 
- smoothness (local variation in radius lengths) 
- compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0) 
- concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour) 
- concave points (number of concave portions of the contour) 
- symmetry 
- fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
