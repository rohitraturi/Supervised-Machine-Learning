# Project Title: Supervised Machine Learning models to predict whether a breast cancer is benign or malignant

## Goal Statement
To create supervised machine learning classification models to predict whether a breast cancer is benign or malignant. Following are the pros and cons associated with these models

Pros
- Can be helpful in medical field
- Can be used as a reference by doctors

Cons
- Misclassification or Error while predicting
- Reliability concerns

## Data Collection
Downloaded the dataset(.csv) from the UIC repository, [click](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic))

## Data Loading
Imported the dataset in to R studio using read.csv()

## Data Exploration
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset. Started with checking for any missing values in dataset followed by checking the structure and summary of dataset. Further, Used ggplot for plotting a bar plot for the number of case type in target feature.
