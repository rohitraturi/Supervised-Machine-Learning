# Project Title: Supervised Machine Learning models to predict customer churn or customer attrition

## Goal Statement
To create supervised machine learning classification models to predict whether a customer will continue or discontinue the service.

## Data Collection
Downloaded the dataset(.csv) from IBM Watson Analytics, [click](https://www.ibm.com/communities/analytics/watson-analytics-blog/guide-to-sample-datasets/)

## Summary
I have followed the CRISP-DM methodology. I started first with data loading followed by data cleaning and exploratory data analysis. Later, I prepared the data for model making and evaluated and compared the models based on accuracy and kappa. Refer the R code.
